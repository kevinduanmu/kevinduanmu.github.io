      <p>Welcome! I am a Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology. 
      My general research interests include nonstandard analysis, mathematical economics, general equilibrium theory, Markov processes, and statistical decision theory.
      Recently, I have been working on general equilibrium theory with applications to environmental regulatory schemes such as cap-and-trade and carbon tax. 
      I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics (2011), master degree in Statistics (2012), and Ph.D. degree in Statistics (2018) all from the University of Toronto. 
      My Ph.D. advisors are Professor Jeffrey Rosenthal (U of T Statistics), Professor William Weiss (U of T Math), and Professor Daniel M.Roy (U of T Statistics). 
      From 2018-2021, I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Robert Anderson (UC Berkeley Economics and Math). 
      I joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022 as a Professor.
